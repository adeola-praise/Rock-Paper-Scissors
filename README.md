# Rock-Paper-Scissors

## Description
A programmed version of the popular hand game "Rock, Paper, Scissors".
#### Play game here: https://adeola-praise.github.io/Rock-Paper-Scissors/
## Why I Built This Project
This project is part of the foundation javascript course of The Odin Project (TOP). I built this project to apply some of the basic knowledge I have gotten so far in learning Javascript.
## How To Play
The game of Rock, Paper, Scissors is played like this: at the same time, two players display one of three symbols: a rock, paper, or scissors. A rock beats scissors by smashing it, scissors beat paper by cutting it, and paper beats rock by covering it. If both players throw the same symbol, the game is tied.
